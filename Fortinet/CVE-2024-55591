The following log entries are possible IOC's:



Following login activity log with random scrip and dstip:
type="event" subtype="system" level="information" vd="root" logdesc="Admin login successful" sn="1733486785" user="admin" ui="jsconsole" method="jsconsole" srcip=1.1.1.1 dstip=1.1.1.1 action="login" status="success" reason="none" profile="super_admin" msg="Administrator admin logged in successfully from jsconsole"




Following admin creation log with seemingly randomly generated user name and source IP:
type="event" subtype="system" level="information" vd="root" logdesc="Object attribute configured" user="admin" ui="jsconsole(127.0.0.1)" action="Add" cfgtid=1411317760 cfgpath="system.admin" cfgobj="vOcep" cfgattr="password[*]accprofile[super_admin]vdom[root]" msg="Add system.admin vOcep"




The following IP addresses were mostly found used by attackers in above logs:
1.1.1.1
127.0.0.1
2.2.2.2
8.8.8.8
8.8.4.4




Please note that the above IP parameters are under attacker control and therefore can be any other IP address.
Please note as well that sn and cfgtid are not relevant to the attack.


The operations performed by the Threat Actor (TA) in the cases we observed were part or all of the below:
- Creating an admin account on the device with random user name
- Creating a Local user account on the device with random user name
- Creating a user group or adding the above local user to an existing sslvpn user group
- Adding/changing other settings (firewall policy, firewall address, ...)
- Logging in the sslvpn with the above added local users to get a tunnel to the internal network.


Admin or Local user created by the TA is randomly generated. e.g:
Gujhmk
Ed8x4k
G0xgey
Pvnw81
Alg7c4
Ypda8a
Kmi8p4
1a2n6t
8ah1t6
M4ix9f
...etc...


Additionally, the TA has been seen using the following IP addresses:
