This is an  active and growing LuaJit campaign leveraging github to distribute malware.  
It seems opportunistic in nature and covers a gambit of topics and programming languages. 
Resilience has seen a swelling in the amount of repositories affected as the number continues to grow from when we first started tracking on 12/19/2025.  
This is not a new campaign but a continuation and expansion of campaigns that have been reported on previously in 2025.

Regardless whether you are a subscriber or user of github.com -- your IT staff, you have employees etc who do use github.com and the reality is this campaign sets out to target them -- trick unsuspecting users into downloading what seems like at a very high level; a useful or compelling tool for a challenge or problem they have.. but it isn’t.. its a stealer.
